# UniNet
LinkedIn scraper/automation

[Defunct as of 12/30/24 (when I last checked it)] A project for the UC Davis Department of Statistics to find all students/employees of a certain University or Organization respectively. Originally, further development included automatic connection requests and analytics parsing for career pathways of alumni, but changes to the LinkedIn wesbite made gathering this info impossible. 

If you still want to collect names for demographics data or otherwise, you can use the 'reqs.txt' to install the necessary libraries for this project. This allows for getting names and short bios of profiles. Requires a verified LinkedIn profile. Do NOT make too many requests for any additional info using this code, since LinkedIn can blacklsit you now.
